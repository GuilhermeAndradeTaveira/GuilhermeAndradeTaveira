Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is Guilherme Andrade, and I'm a computer science student at CEFET/RJ. I have a strong interest in back-end development and cybersecurity. I'm constantly seeking to improve my skills and expand my knowledge of technology. Here, you'll find the efforts I've made to deliver high-quality solutions in various programming languages. Feel free to browse through my repositories and contribute to my projects.

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you!
